# Data-engineering-projects
Here I will upload the data engineering projects that I have done, from simple to more difficult


first project : Data Extraction and Integration from API
in this project I have work with api to import data the api and data it is from World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory (GHO) (https://www.who.int/data/gho/info/gho-odata-api)
and a make some cleaning, preprocessing and transforming on data then I make Integration between 2 data set . after that I'm Loading the data and executing queries in MySQL Database Server. 


Second project : Building Data Pipeline
In this project the main idea is to deal with the Pipeline, the first thinf i do it's the ETL Implementation which i Extraction Data from local server then Data Transformation such as (cleaning, filtering and transforming) Consider handling missing values, filtering outliers, remove duplicate records andany other necessary transformations. Then after that Machine Learning Model Integration, I applies a machine learning model for a classification task. And the last thing is Data Loading, I load the transformed data into a MySQL database on localhost.
